Coming to the bar, you quickly scan the room for the man with the raven, who is not hard to spot. He sits at a booth
across from a gargantuan brute who is comically wedged between table and seat. Before you have a chance to interrupt,
the barbarian abruptly stands, towering above and unapologetically colliding with your shoulder. The force nearly knocks
you off your feet. He turns and points a thick finger at Vozzbozz.
'Do not forget what we have agreed, elder one!', he bellows intensely.
You look at Vozzbozz. It is then that you notice his face; large, rounded features, wide lips perpetually
turned up into a half-smile, and bold black eyebrows. His big, brown eyes are opened almost uncomfortably wide,
giving the appearance of one endlessly fascinated or entertained.
