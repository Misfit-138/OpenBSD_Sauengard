# Sauengard

> SAUENGARD is an old-school *text adventure* inspired by microcomputer
games from the 1970's and 1980's such as Infocom's Zork series,
Telengard by Daniel Lawrence, as well as Milton Bradley's 
brilliant Dark Tower tabletop electronic board game.
It is a fun and immersive RPG with relatively sophisticated 
battle system, great loot and inventory, customizable character
creation, an epic quest, and leveling. It also features immersive atmospherics, 
>and ASCII artwork. Sauengard runs in the console, or within a virtual console.

## Development:

- I originally added background music licensed under the Creative Commons
license, but had difficulty with the sound system on POSIX systems.
Anyone willing to help with a sound port is welcome. 
It should be quite simple for anyone with basic Python knowledge.
